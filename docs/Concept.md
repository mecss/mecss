- an alias exist only if the property is **5 characters or less**
- if possible, make the alias with **as few characters as possible**. Example:
> `background` & `border` begin with **b**. So, the aliases will be `bg`& `bd`
- Same logic for the **multiple-keywords properties**. Example:
> `border-start-end-radius` will become `bd-st-e-rd`
